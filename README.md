# OTR---LaTeX
OTR (Optical Table Recognition) is a project I made to convert screenshots of tables into fully integratable and customizable LaTeX tables. Made possible using Python (SciPy, Pillow) and Tesseract OCR software

##Features:
**22 - 06 - 2019**
* Can find the horizontal and vertical lines that make up the column (Reliability: Very, 95% in testcases)
* Can find horizontal and vertical seperators made by negative space (Reliability: Fairly, 80%, has trouble with some testcases)
* Because of the above two features it can find the _bounding boxes_ of text fairly accurately, with its reliability dependent on the ones above
* Can find how each column of text is centered(Left - Right - Center)(Reliability: High, 85%-95%, need more advanced testcases to properly test)

##In Development:
**22 - 06 - 2019**
* Further reliability improvement and testing with more advanced test case (Intend to get everything to a reliability of 95%)
* Integration with Tesseract OCR Software to actually convert the table into text
